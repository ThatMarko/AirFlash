//! Receiver ownership checks under `receiver_ownership_guard`.
//!
//! [`Tracker`] classifies probe results and schedules confirmations. The
//! session applies the verdict. `Requeue` and `Reclaim` are historical action
//! names. Both end the current attempt.
//!
//! | Tracker action | Session outcome |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`ProbeAction::Confirm`] | Keep streaming until the confirmation probe. |
//! | [`ProbeAction::FallThrough`] | Keep streaming. Re-probe `Unknown` liveness after [`LIVENESS_RETRY`]. |
//! | [`ProbeAction::Requeue`] | Yield `preempted` with reason `takeover` when the receiver ended our session and is still busy. Otherwise yield `ownership_unconfirmed`. |
//! | [`ProbeAction::Reclaim`] | Yield retryable `peer_closed` only when the confirmation probe itself read `Free`. Otherwise yield `ownership_unconfirmed`. |
//!
//! A disagreeing confirmation or an ownership check still open 15 s after
//! feedback loss, clock loss, or an unexpected `TEARDOWN` also yields
//! `ownership_unconfirmed`. A yield stops the whole group and suppresses its
//! old `TEARDOWN` requests. The affected member suspends its tracker, including
//! any busy re-probe scheduled by [`REPROBE_BACKOFF`].
//!
//! `preempted` and `ownership_unconfirmed` require manual reconnect. When a
//! clock fault is pending, the sender reports retryable `clock_lost` in place
//! of the confirmed-free `peer_closed`. Every automatic start, including
//! desktop retry, standby resume, and capture-source restart, must first get
//! an inactive session from every member in two read-only `/info` rounds
//! [`CONFIRM_DELAY`] apart before SETUP. See `docs/RECEIVER-OWNERSHIP.md`.
//!
//! ## Probe inputs
//!
//! Control-plane symptoms schedule a probe. The background probe combines a
//! TCP liveness check on the receiver's control port and a fresh `GET /info`
//! with the session's local evidence. A successful UDP write only shows local
//! socket acceptance. A receiver-initiated `TEARDOWN`, feedback loss, or clock
//! loss invalidates the corresponding healthy-media assumption. Authentication
//! faults on the feedback channel follow the authentication fault path.
//!
//! [`classify`] interprets the 64-bit `statusFlags` field. Its session-active
//! bit can describe our session or another controller's, so the classifier
//! also takes the caller's association context. [`combine`] preserves the
//! distinction between `Refused` and `Dead` in the liveness evidence while
//! classifying both as `Gone`. [`LivenessTracker`] bounds consecutive unknown
//! samples. The first `Free` or `BusyElsewhere` verdict schedules a confirmation
//! after [`CONFIRM_DELAY`].
//!
//! The group-wide gateway reference model ([`judge_all_failed`]) is exercised
//! by tests. The live session does not run it. Each member's background probe
//! completes independently, and the sender applies its verdict without
//! waiting for a synchronized group round or connecting to the gateway.
