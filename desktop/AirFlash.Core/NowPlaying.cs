/// only forwards a sample when the tags or the playback state changed, or when the
/// position is far enough from where the receiver's own interpolation has it (the
/// last published position plus the time since, while playing) to be visibly
/// wrong. Steady playback is therefore not re-sent every poll, even though the
/// source reports a moving position.
/// <para>
/// When the source goes away (no media session, or nothing displayable) nothing is
/// forwarded, so an active receiver keeps its display. The pump does forget what it
/// published and raises <see cref="SourceCleared"/> once, so a player that comes back
/// on the same track and position is sent again, and owners can drop their cached
/// copy instead of showing it in a session started later.
